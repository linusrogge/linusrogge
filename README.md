## hi there ðŸ‘‹

this is linus, a designer and developer from hamburg. i focus on user-friendly experiences all across web, mobile and desktop. during over five years of experience, i have worked at multiple start-ups and currently work as a self-employed freelancer. i am still trapped in what's called high-school but it is not long to go to explore more parts of the wolrd.

also, i work with the folks at [major keys](https://majorkeys.de) to build up the idea of online piano lessons where you can learn at your own speed an always have a coach available to help you with any struggles. i love it!

at the moment, i'm mostly working with html, css(scss), javascript, GoHugo, Vue.js and SwiftUI

### personal

since february 2020, i am self-employed and founded my first _company_. doing this with 15 years was not easy, but i managed to get everything up and running. check more on [linuscodes.com](https://linuscodes.com) _new site launching soon!_

feel free to follow my journey on [instagram (@linuscodes)](https://instagram.com/linuscodes) or on [twitter (@linuscodes)](https://twitter.com/linuscodes). sometimes, i write down some thoughts and publish them on [medium (@linuscodes)](https://linuscodes.medium.com) as well.

**have a great day! ðŸ¤©**
